## BlackJack-Game
It is a modified version of the actual BlackJack game in Python. The game has two players, a computer dealer and a human player. At the start of the game, the human player purchases some chips to play. Out of his purchased chips, he puts some on bet. Both the players start with two cards each and tries to get closer to a total value of 21 without busting. The possible actions for human player are hit (to get a new card) and stay (to stop getting new cards and let the dealer play his turn) while the dealer hits until it either beats the player or busts out. The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as a value 10 and the ace card can count as either 1 or 11, which ever value is preferable to the user. If the human player loses the game, the amount invested as a bet is lost too. But if he wins, he doubles his bet money.
